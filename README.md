# GitHub Action for deploy Pull Requests in Google Kubernetes Service for Moleculer App
      
## Description
A Github Action to deploy previews of Pull Requests to GKE via Moleculer Helm Package ðŸš€

Deploy previews
 - build docker image + tag with meta preview tags
 - publish docker image to container registry
 - create an external IP address
 - create a DNS.
 - deploy chart / preview in Kubernetes
 - add a preview comment to pull request with link to preview

## Prerequisite
This action is (currently) tightly coupled to the following set of tools. 
- Kubernetes cluster (GKE)
- GCP token for authentication
- google registery as container registry (could work with others, but not tested)
- Domain zone hosted on Google cloud
- Moleculer app
- Dockerfile for the application

## Example deployment

```yaml
name: "deploy-pr"
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened, synchronize]
  
jobs:
  hello_world_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy-pr
    steps:
      - uses: knawat/github-actions-deploy-moleculer@main
        with: 
          #APPLICATION VARIABLE
          SERVICES: {api,products}
          SERVICEDIR: build/services
          MOLECULER_APM_ENABLE: 1
          AGENT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AGENT_TOKEN }}
          AGENT_APIKEY: ${{ secrets.AGENT_APIKEY }}
          TRANSPORTER: tcp
          MONGO_URI: '${{ secrets.MONGO_URI }}' //should include it between ''
          BASE_URL: api.example.com //The gateway URL of your app, the deployment PR URL will be 'pr-[PR_NUMBER].[BASE_URL]'
          HELM_SET: ${{ secrets.HELM_SET }} //To include any other application env var (environment.env.VAR1=VAL1)
          # GCP Configuration 
          DNS_ZONE_NAME: 'EXAMPLE-COM' //It's the cloud DNS Zone name not the DNS name (P.S. DNS name is example.com)
          GCP_PROJECT: 'example-project'
          GCP_JSON_KEY: ${{ secrets.GCP_JSON_KEY }}
          #DOCKER CONFIGURATION
          DOCKER_REGISTRY: 'gcr.io'
          IMAGE_REPO_NAME: 'api'
          IMAGE_TAGS: "$GITHUB_SHA" 
          #K8S Configuration
          CLUSTER_NAME: "cluster-dev"
          CLUSTER_LOCATION: "us-central1-c"
          CONTAINER_NAME: "app"
          #GitHub Configuration
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Usage

If the SERVICES conatins API service, it will create:
1. External IP: "RepoName"-"PR_Number"-pr
    so, for example: I'm working on a repo name: "knawat/app" and I created a PR (263), the IP will create with the following name: app-263-pr
2. DNS: pr-"PR_Number"."BASE_URL"
    so, if I set the BASE_URL=api.knawat.io in the env, the DNS will create with the following name: pr-263.api.knawat.io and it's point to the previous IP address.
3. For moleculer helm package will create the ingress.

If you need to add environment variables to your application you can use HELM_SET variable:

```yaml
 with: 
     HELM_SET: environment.env.VAR1=VAL1,environment.env.VAR2=VAL2
```

If you need to enable molecler Lab:

```yaml
 with: 
     MOLECULER_APM_ENABLE: 1
     AGENT_TOKEN: YourApiToken
     AGENT_APIKEY: YourApiKey
```

If you need to change the transporter use by the application:

```yaml
 with: 
     TRANSPORTER: nats://nats:4222
```
